 The weak formulation of our PDE is given by
 
 \[\langle L u,v\rangle = \langle f,v \rangle \]
 
 The way we solved for u is by representing u as 
  \[\hat{u} = \sum_{j=0}^{N} c_j \psi_j\]
where the $\psi$ are bilinear piecewise functions. Since u has inhomogeneous boundaries, we need basis functions for the boundaries.

Then, we solve a system of equations
  \[\langle L u,\psi_j\rangle = \langle f,\psi_j \rangle \]

\[\langle f,\psi_j \rangle = \int \int_{\Omega} f(x,y) psi_j dx dy  \]

\[\langle L u,\psi_j\rangle = \int \int_{\Omega} (\hat{u}_{xx} \psi_j + \hat{u}_{yy}\psi_j)dx dy \]
\[= - \int \int_{\Omega} (\hat{u}_{x}\psi_j + \hat{u}_{y} \psi_j)dx dy + 
\int_{d \Omega} (\hat{u}_{n}\psi_j )dr
\]
\[= - \sum_{k=0}^{N} c_k \int \int_{\Omega} ({\psi_k}_{x}\psi_j + {\psi_k}_{y} \psi_j)dx dy + 
\int_{d \Omega} ({\psi_k}_{n}\psi_j )dr
\]

The second term doesn't vanish because we have non-zero boundaries. 
Evaluating the integrals, we get a system of equations which we can solve to find the coefficients.

The corner boundary basis functions are different from the interior boundary basis functions.
 The interior ones are rectangular like the ones below  
 At the top
   \[
    \psi(x, y) = \left\{\begin{array}{lr}
       \frac{(x-x_{i-1})(y-y_1)}{(x_i-x_{i-1})(0-y_1)}, & \text{for } [x_{i-1},x_{i}]x[0,y_1]\\
    \frac{(x-x_{i+1})(y-y_1)}{(x_i-x_{i+})(0-y_1)}, & \text{for } [x_{i},x_{i+1}]x[0,y_1]\\
        0, & \text{elsewhere } 
        \end{array}\right\} \]
        At the bottom
           \[
    \psi(x, y) = \left\{\begin{array}{lr}
         \frac{(x-x_{i-1})(y-y_{n-1})}{(x_i-x_{i-1})(1-y_{n-1})}, & \text{for } [x_{i-1},x_{i}]x[y_{n-1},1]\\
 \frac{(x-x_{i+1})(y-y_{n-1})}{(x_i-x_{i+1})(1-y_{n-1})}, & \text{for } [x_{i},x_{i+1}]x[y_{n-1},1]\\
        0, & \text{elsewhere } 
        \end{array}\right\} \]
        Similarly, we can write down left and right interior boundary basis functions
A corner boundary will be non-zero only on half the rectangle. For example, in the top left corner,
   \[
    \psi(x, y) = \left\{\begin{array}{lr}

    \frac{(x-x_{i+1})(y-y_1)}{(x_i-x_{i+})(0-y_1)}, & \text{for } [x_{i},x_{i+1}]x[0,y_1]\\
        0, & \text{elsewhere } 
        \end{array}\right\} \]
